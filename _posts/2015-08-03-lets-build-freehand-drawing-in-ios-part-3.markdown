This the third and final post of tutorials in which we build **Freehand Drawing** for iOS. In this part we will improve how the stroke looks and feels.

You can check the previous posts here:
- [Part 1][post1]: Naive implementation
- [Part 2][post2]: Refactor and undo

In the last post we did a refactor and implemented undo functionality, thus finishing all the features of our small drawing application. Now it is time to improve the look and feel of the drawing itself.

# Connecting the dots

# Adding a curve

# Changing stroke width

# Conclusion

We’ve improved the stroke of our small drawing application, by connecting the dots using more than just straight lines. We’ve also achieved a more realistic and playful feel by changing the width of the stroke depending on the speed of the user touches. 

During the course of these tutorials we have seen what technical challenges a developer may be faced when implementing such features, and evolved our code as needed by refactoring and redesigning as our requirements change.

The repository with the latest changes can be found [here][final].
